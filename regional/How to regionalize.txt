Thank you for helping to translate!  Here's what I need you to do.

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE LATEST VERSION OF THIS FILE FROM:
http://www.randomwisdom.com/files/NRage_DInput8_Lang_SDK.zip

Open up this .rc file in a text editor that can save in _Unicode format_
 (not UTF-8 but 16-bit Unicode).

Scroll down to about line 160, where you will see the text:
"N-Rage Input Plugin V2 - Configuration"
Please replace this text, leaving the quotes in place.

From this point on, please find things in quotes and replace them with the translation.

Do not translate:
-anything containing PLACEHOLDER (as it won't be displayed anyway)
-"MS Shell Dlg" (this is a font name)
-system words like "SysListView32"
-the word "Button" as in the following example:
    CONTROL         "Plugged",IDC_PLUGGED,"Button",BS_AUTOCHECKBOX |

	In this case, please translate the word "Plugged" but leave the word "Button"
	as it is a special identifier.

---Special cases---

When you see a string like "Player %i:\nPak changed to %s", the markers %i and %s
will be replaced by some data (in this case, the player number and the pakname).
Make sure your translation has the same markers in the same order.  Otherwise,
the plugin will crash!

---Special characters---
If you need to put a newline (like the Enter key), use this: \n
If you need to put a % sign (as in "50% chance"), use this: %%

Save the file in Unicode format, and send it to me along with your name.

Some of the English is ambiguous in context, so if you have a question about where
the given text appears, please ask me.


The resource.h file is here in case you want to compile it into a DLL yourself or check
the spacing with a dialog editor.  If you don't know what this means, don't worry about
it.
